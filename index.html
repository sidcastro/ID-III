    <div class="description">
      The MTA is reinventing the Metrocard system in order to increase efficiency and descrease station congestion for fellow MTA riders.
      We will be utilizing BioMetric hand scanners at each subway station, allowing riders to enter the station using the newest hand-scanning technology.
      Riders will be able to prepay for trips ID'd by their hand-print, and enter the station with a simple swipe of their hand.
    </br></br><u>Goodbye MTA hassle.</u>
